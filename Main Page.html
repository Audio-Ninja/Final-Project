        <h1>Final Project</h1>
        <p>This is my Final Project for my 2023 class in Web Design 2. In my final project, I have a few pages I've created over the course of a few weeks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A <a href="Magic 8 Ball.html">Magic 8 Ball</a> to predict answers to questions.</p>
        <p>A <a href="2 Player Fighting Game/Game.html">Fighting Game</a> with two controllable fighters who can compete to win.</p>
        <p>A <a href="Platformer/Main.html">Platformer</a> game where you squish enemies and collect coins to get points.</p>
